Snakebite
----------------

Snakebite is a Force Touch app launcher. It works by hijacking iOS 9's left-edge Force-Touch multitasking gesture. This gesture does not exist on non-Force-Touch devices, however, so for those we use the system gesture manager to add a device-wide gesture to invoke Snakebite.

Snakebite allows the user several customization options, such as a light and dark mode, choosing between showing the user's favorite apps or most recently used apps, number of apps shown, and more. 

Feel free to learn from Snakebite, but please provide attribution if you base your work off of it, and don't repackage the code and call it your own. GPL v3?
